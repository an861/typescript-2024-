1. Whta typescript does?
STATIC CHECKING -> Analyses our code as we type. Before running the code at runtime, it will show us error if any.

2. Difference between JS & TS.
-> TS = Object-Oriented Language, JS = Prototype based Language
   TS = Static Checking/Typing  , JS = Dynamically Typing
   TS = Supports Interface      , JS = Doesn't Supports

3. TS is transpiled to JS meaning TS is converted to JS. TS is a development tool and the project is using the JS only.
   TS is a wrapper around JS with more core scalability, readibility, better code.

4. global installation of TS -> npm install -g typescript
   project installation of TS -> npm install typescript --save-dev
   tsc will help us to execute the TS files

5. Type Inference -> TS is smart enough to detect the type of the variable without defining it.
